# Markdown

This is a test file for __experimentation__ with _markdown_. Combining boldface with italics can be **_done_**. We can also ~~strikethrough~~.

## Listing

Lists can be useful for:
1. Listing items
2. Making lists more readable
    1. listing items in sublists
3. Adding items thereafter.


We can also have unordered lists, to avoid hierarchy:
- like this
- and this
  * and subitems
- and further items

   We can slo have paragraph indenting.

## Displaying code

We can display inline code like this `cat textfile.md`. Or we can put in a block of code of any language.
```python
import numpy as np

numbers = np.random.rand(100)
```
